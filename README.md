# Description of the folders #

  * *src*: Folder with source codes.

  * *datasets*: Folder with the instances.

  * *results*: Folder with the results.

# Descriptions of the main source code files #

  *  *2017_CLP_CL_dynProg.jl*: Reads the cost of the states and runs the dynamic programming algorithm. Results are saved in the form CLTAC-dyn-x, x = {1, 2, 4}.

  *  *2017_CLP_CL_dynProgPreprocess.jl*: Solves the CLP for each instance in the dataset. It solves 10 versions of the problem. Considering boxes available up until t=1, then t=2, ..., t=10.

  *  *2018_CLP_CL_dynProgAllStates.jl*: Solves each possible state to be used in the dynamic programming algorithm.

  * *2018_CLP_CL_dynPackingKnapsack.jl*: Runs the simulation for the arrival of the boxes using the solution from the dynamic programming to decided whether to load or wait for more boxes.

  * *2018_CLP_CL_dynPackingBoxSetManipulator.jl*: Auxiliary function to manipulate the boxes set that arrive.

# Description of the dataset #

The dataset consists of 97 instances: 47 instances based on _Ivancic et al. (1989)_ (thpack) and 50 based on _Bischoff and Ratcliff (1995)_ and _Davies and Bischoff (1999)_ (br) with the time generated randomly. Please, refer to the manuscript for details.

The first line of the file has three integers corresponding to the dimensions (length, width and height) of the container. The following lines represent the boxes, one per line. Each box is defined by four integer numbers: Its dimensions (length, width and height) follow by the time from which it becomes available.

# Description of the results #

The files named *CLP_preprocessFair.X.t* consists of the solution generated by the code *2017_CLP_CL_dynProgPreprocessFair.jl*. X is the number of the instance and t is related to the boxes available up until t.

The folder *dyn_prog_thpack* and *dyn_prog_br* with files *make.out_x and volume.out_x* summarize the results of the dynamic programming algorithm for different values of the cost of empty space, x = {1, 2, 4} and different probabilities of arrival {0.5, 0.6, ..., 1.0} for thpack and br instances, respectively.

The folder *CLPTAC_dynProg_AllStates* consists of files storing a solution of one possible state in the dynamic programming algorithm. For each state there is a file.
